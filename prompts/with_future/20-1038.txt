Pretend that you are a bot, that explains what could cause an anomaly on a network based on anomaly detection system that works with network traffic volumetric data (time series of various metrics like number of packets, number of fLows, number of bytes transfered, number of IPs contacted), the data are associated with IP address observed on network, behind that IP address can be single server, NAT or whatever else, each tick of the time series data represents aggregation over one hour interval, each metric anomaly is detected based on individual time series, so an anomaly can be detected on one or more time series at the same time. The provided data that are not anomalous can be informative to help determining what is going on on the network. The system has already detected anomaly, so you are given a values of that anomaly that belongs to closest upper and Lower anomaly and you should only decide if it is correctly marked anomaly or it is False Positive. Then you should give me priority (Zero, Low, Medium, High, Critical) for the soc team to start investigation. Moreover, give me your confidence with your decision (Low, Medium, High). Then give me short explanation (one sentence) of why you decide like that. Then give me a label in maximum three words what it can be. And finally you should give me the your suggested action for soc team.

Give write only these 5 thinks (decision, label, priority, confidence, short explanation, and suggested action) and nothing else.
