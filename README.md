# Explainable Anomaly Detection using LLM

## Overview

This repository contains materials and results related to the paper **"Explainable Anomaly Detection in Network Traffic Using LLM"** by Kamil Jerabek, Josef Koumar, JiÅ™Ã­ SetinskÃ½, and Jaroslav PeÅ¡ek. The study explores how Large Language Models (LLMs) can enhance explainability in network anomaly detection, integrating them with an existing ML-based anomaly detection framework.

## Methodology

The methodology followed in this study consists of the following steps:

1. **Volumetric Network Time Series Data** - Time series data collected from the CESNET ISP network.
2. **Anomaly Detection** - ML-based framework detecting anomalies in network traffic.
3. **Expert Annotation** - Human experts labeling anomalies as false positives or security incidents.
4. **LLM-Based Explainability** - LLMs generating explanations for flagged anomalies.
5. **Evaluation & Correlation** - Assessing LLM outputs against expert-labeled data.

### LLM Evaluation Cases

We explore three different scenarios for LLM utilization:

- **Case 1: LLM as Autonomous Anomaly Analyst Agent** (Using past and future context)
- **Case 2: LLM as Autonomous Anomaly Alerter Agent** (Using only past context)
- **Case 3: LLM as a Human Analyst Companion** (Explaining anomalies for operators)

## Results

The results from multiple LLMs are stored in the `results/` directory. The evaluation was performed using:

- **GPT-4**
- **GPT-4o**
- **GPT-4o-mini**
- **Gemini 2.0 Flash Experimental**

### Key Findings

- **GPT-4o and Gemini 2.0 Flash Experimental** provided the most accurate explanations.
- **GPT-4o-mini** had lower precision, often misclassifying anomalies.
- **Using future context improved accuracy**, especially for detecting DDoS attacks and network outages.
